# IWSDK project

A Vite + TypeScript or JavaScript app, but several things do **not** work the way
a normal Vite project works. Read this section before assuming anything.

Deeper material is installed in each selected harness's native path-scoped rule
format. Harnesses that use `AGENTS.md` also receive equivalent nested files near
the code they govern. Read the applicable scoped instructions before working in
that area.

Explain immersive terms in plain language when they first matter instead of
assuming the reader knows them. In particular, introduce XR (an immersive
session), IWER (IWSDK's browser-based XR emulator), ECS (entity-component
system), and controller target-ray versus grip poses with a link to the
applicable IWSDK guide or concept page.

## What is not standard Vite

**`iwsdk.config.json` is the project authority, not `vite.config.ts`.** It selects
the active scene, the asset module, the component module, and all XR/world
features. `vite.config.ts` only wires the plugin. Editing `iwsdk.config.json`
restarts Vite in place; the managed window remains open and its command bridges
reconnect automatically. Wait for `npx @iwsdk/cli dev status` to report
`browserCommandReady: true` before issuing browser-backed commands.

**`virtual:iwsdk-project` is a virtual module**, not a file. `src/index.ts` or
`src/index.js` imports it and passes it whole to `World.create()`. Do not
hand-build that options object.

**The dev server is CLI-managed.** Use `npx @iwsdk/cli dev up` (or `npm run dev`), not
`vite`. It launches a managed browser that hosts the MCP command bridge.
`--no-open` starts the server with managed-browser launch disabled. Server status
and explicitly paired physical targets remain available. A targetless managed
browser command then fails with `browser_not_launched`; it never falls through
to a physical page. Commands default to the managed browser. One managed
window hosts the editor and application roles. Browser failure leaves Vite and
HMR running. `runtime status`, `runtime targets`, and `runtime wait` do not recover
or launch a browser; `runtime recover` explicitly retries after a failure.

Pair a headset using `runtime pair-headset --input-json '{"headsetId":"ADB_SERIAL"}'`,
open the returned URL on that exact device through ADB reverse, then copy its
`runtimeTarget` from `runtime targets`. Include deviceClass, headsetId, pageId, and
tabGeneration on every physical command. Reload is supported through the page
bridge; screenshot, snapshot, interaction, profiling, console capture, and the
managed editor are host-only. Rediscover after reload to get the new generation.

The developer owns whether that managed window is headed or headless. Do not
change modes silently: announce the change before restarting. In a visible
collaboration session, use the Runtime/Editor toggle in the single managed
Chromium window. Its expected unsupported-flag banner comes from
`--ignore-certificate-errors` for the local development certificate. Playwright
may add separate sandbox-related flags in constrained environments.

**`src/assets.ts`/`src/assets.js` is evaluated twice, in two different JS
realms** — once by the app runtime, once by the editor. It must be deterministic
and side-effect free: no `World`, no DOM, no timers, no reliance on shared object
identity.

**Static geometry lives in TypeScript, composition lives in JSON.** Scene JSON
never declares URLs, geometry or materials — only manifest IDs.

**Components must be declared in a system-free module** and exported from
`src/components.ts`/`src/components.js` via `defineComponents()`. The editor
imports that same manifest to build its inspector, so a component that is not in
it cannot be authored in scenes.

**Import Three.js from `@iwsdk/core`, never from `three`.** `@iwsdk/core`
re-exports all of Three; importing `three` directly creates a duplicate instance
and subtle breakage. Exception: `import type { GLTF } from 'three/addons/...'`.

## Verify before you claim it works

**Always `npm run --if-present typecheck` before testing.** Type errors stop systems
initialising without necessarily logging anything in the browser.

For a new multi-file procedural model, finish the initial asset module and manifest
registration before `npx @iwsdk/cli dev up`; do not keep the browser live while its import
graph is half-written. Typecheck first, then launch the managed editor for inspection.

Then check the right status for the task — these are not interchangeable:

- scene/editor work → `scene_get_state`
- XR device or session actions → `xr_get_session_status`
- server readiness → `npx @iwsdk/cli dev status` (XR availability is not a server signal)

When something is missing but the console is clean: call
`browser_get_console_logs` with only `count` (a `level` filter hides errors), then
`ecs_find_entities` to confirm the entity exists and carries the components you
expect.

The non-obvious part is which observation proves what: the **editor** render does
not run application systems, so anything driven by a system must be verified with
`browser_screenshot` (runtime), not `scene_screenshot` (editor).

Pose, controller/hand alignment, and immersive interaction claims require an
active XR session (`npx @iwsdk/cli xr status`). A flat runtime screenshot taken
outside XR can prove that the app renders, but it cannot prove immersive pose or
interaction correctness.

For a physical headset smoke test, run `npx @iwsdk/cli dev status`, open a URL from
`data.runtimeUrls.network` on a headset connected to the same Wi-Fi network,
and accept the expected local certificate warning. See
[Testing Your Experience](https://iwsdk.dev/guides/02-testing-experience.html)
for the complete workflow.

## MCP and CLI are one surface, not two

Nearly every capability exists both ways — `scene_render_file` and
`npx @iwsdk/cli scene render-file`, `ecs_find_entities` and `npx @iwsdk/cli ecs find`,
or `ui_inspect` and `npx @iwsdk/cli ui inspect`.
Discover CLI actions with the bare domain or domain help (`npx @iwsdk/cli scene` or
`npx @iwsdk/cli scene --help`); both list that domain's actions.

**CLI and MCP share the same target resolver and recovery policy.** A managed
command can recover a missing managed browser; it then returns
`browser_relaunched` with `outcome: "not_executed"`. Inspect the new state and issue
a fresh command. `outcome_unknown` means a dispatched mutation may have executed;
inspect state before retrying. Requests are never broadcast or replayed on
reconnect. Host browser tools can remain usable while a runtime bridge is loading.

Choose by the shape of the call, not by availability:

- **MCP** for one-off calls. Screenshot tools persist the PNG locally and return
  `screenshotPath`; read that file only when visual inspection is needed.
- **CLI** when you need to loop or script — rendering six views, or sampling a
  value twice to measure a rate — or when the response is big enough to be worth
  filtering before it reaches context. A render of a scene containing an
  instanced pattern returns an id for every expanded instance.

For screenshot-producing CLI commands, the default response writes the image to a
temporary file and returns a normal envelope with metadata under `data.result` and
the path at `data.screenshotPath`. `--output-file <path>` selects the destination and
keeps that same metadata, including hashes and render statistics. `--raw` instead
prints the raw runtime result, including base64 `imageData`; when both flags are
present, `--output-file` takes precedence and image bytes are omitted.

## Skills

Invoke `iwsdk-dev` first for any request that builds, extends, fixes, tunes,
or polishes the app. It privately selects the greenfield planner path or the
bounded established-app iteration path; do not look for those paths as separate
public skills.

The selected playbook routes work to the narrowest owning specialist:

- creating or materially changing one glTF or procedural 3D asset →
  `iwsdk-build-model`;
- arranging existing assets, scene JSON, cross-asset contacts, lighting,
  environment, or cameras → `iwsdk-compose-scene`;
- a mixed build → finish every new or changed model, including support and set assets,
  with `iwsdk-build-model`, then compose the scene with `iwsdk-compose-scene`;
- a model-local defect found during composition routes back to `iwsdk-build-model`;
  a placement or lighting defect stays in `iwsdk-compose-scene`.

UI authoring, physics, depth occlusion, grab and ray interaction testing, ECS
frame-stepping, and debugging have their own project skills. Use them only when
the selected `iwsdk-dev` playbook calls for the matching specialty.

The failure worth guarding against is improvising a domain that already has a
skill because the naive approach looks tractable. Before hand-authoring scene
JSON, a 3D model, a UIKitML panel, or a physics body, invoke the owning skill.

## Layout

```
iwsdk.config.json      project authority: scene, assets, components, world, dev
src/index.ts|js        World.create() + explicit system registration
src/assets.ts|js       defineAssets() — shared runtime/editor catalog
src/components.ts|js   defineComponents() — shared runtime/editor catalog
src/scene-assets/      *.scene-asset.ts|js — parentless Object3D prototypes
public/scenes/         *.iwsdk.scene.json — composition only
public/ui/             *.uikitml — runtime-loaded panels
```

No barrel `index.ts` files. Keep component declarations free of system, DOM and
renderer imports; systems import the declarations, never the reverse.

## Conventions

- Systems use queries, never manually tracked entity arrays.
- Never allocate in `update()`. Allocate in `init()` as class properties.
- Prefer `queries.x.subscribe('qualify', ...)` over polling state each frame.
- Register every subscription teardown in `this.cleanupFuncs`.
- Use `signal.peek()` in `update()`; `.value` adds per-frame subscription overhead.
- Load assets through `AssetManager` / the manifest, never a raw `GLTFLoader`.
- Create entities with `world.createTransformEntity(...)`, never `scene.add()`.
- Use the `RayInteractable` component, never a manual `Raycaster`.
- VR targets 72–90 fps: 11–14 ms per frame. Treat per-frame allocation as a bug.

## Deep reference

Harness-native scoped rules cover `public/scenes/**`, `public/ui/**`,
`src/assets.ts`, `src/scene-assets/**`, and `src/**/*.ts`. `AGENTS.md`-based
harnesses receive nested instruction files; Cursor and Copilot receive their
native rule formats. Skill procedures live in the selected harness's project
skill directory and state when they apply.
